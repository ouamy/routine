## Introduction

Welcome to the Mawaqit API documentation!

Mawaqi Api is a Rest API for mawaqit.net using the FastAPI framework. The mawaqit.net website provides prayer times for more than 8000 mosques around the world. The idea behind this API is to create a web API that utilizes the mawaqit website as a data source to fetch prayer times and return them in JSON format with the minimum necessary information.

By using this API, developers can easily integrate prayer time functionality into their frontend web applications, mobile apps, or other software projects. Instead of manually scraping HTML from the mawaqit.net website, developers can simply make requests to the API and receive well-structured JSON responses, streamlining the development process.

Furthermore, by using this API, developers have the flexibility to self-host the solution, providing them with full control over the data and ensuring reliability and scalability for their applications.
